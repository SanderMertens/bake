/** Load a resource.
 * The ut_use function provides a single interface to loading files or
 * packages into corto. The function accepts any filetype known to corto (types
 * are registered as packages in the driver/ext scope).
 *
 * When a provided resource identifier contains a '.', the string after the '.'
 * is treated as a file extension, and `ut_use` will treat the identifier as
 * a filename. If the identifier contains multiple dots, the last dot will be
 * used to extract the extension.
 *
 * If the identifier contains no dots, `ut_use` will treat the identifier as
 * a logical package name. In this case, `ut_use` will use `ut_locate` to
 * find the package image. Each identifier will only be looked up once, after
 * which the result is cached.
 *
 * The argc and argv parameters can be optionally passed to the resource if the
 * resource type supports it. This is most commonly used for passing parameters
 * to the `cortomain` function of packages.
 *
 * If a resource is found, the handler for the resource type will be executed.
 * This mechanism is used by library loader to invoke the `cortomain` function,
 * but can also involve loading an XML file or executing a corto script,
 * depending on how the resource type is implemented.
 *
 * Resource types are regular packages located in the `driver/ext` scope. They
 * need to call `ut_load_register` in their `cortomain` function to register
 * the resource type handler, which determines how a resource is loaded.
 *
 * @param identifier The resource identifier (either a file or a package)
 * @param argc The number of arguments to pass to the resource
 * @param argv The arguments to pass to the resource (array must be NULL terminated).
 * @return Zero if success, nonzero if failed.

/** Find project locations in the package hierarchy.
 * The `ut_locate` function can be used to locate a package on disk, and to
 * obtain information about the various locations associated with a package.
 *
 * The function accepts a logical package identifier. Local package identifiers
 * are the same across platforms and are equal to the identifier of the package
 * object once loaded into the corto object store. A package identifier is
 * formatted like any other object identifier, in the form `/foo/bar`. The
 * initial `/` is optional.
 *
 * The function looks in three locations, `$BAKE_HOME`, `$BAKE_TARGET` and
 * the global package repository (`/usr/local` on Linux based systems). From
 * these locations `ut_locate` selects the newest version of the package it can
 * find. It also performs a test to ensure that the package has been compiled
 * with the same corto library.
 *
 * A package is only located once. After the first lookup, the result is cached.
 * That means that if a newer version of a package is installed while applications
 * are running, these applications will have to be restarted to see the new
 * package if it is in a different location.
 *
 * If the package has already been loaded by `ut_use` or equivalent function,
 * the function returns a pointer to the library object through the `dl_out`
 * parameter.
 *
 * @param package A logical package name.
 * @param dl_out Will be set to library object, if already loaded.
 * @param kind Specify which information should be obtained from package.
 * @return The requested information.

/** Load a resource from a library.

 * If `dl_out` is set to an existing library object, the `package` parameter is
 * ignored and the function will perform a lookup on the library directly. If
 * `dl_out` has no been set, the function will lookup the library, and assign the
 * `dl_out` parameter to the library object, if found. This facilitates doing
 * efficient repeated lookups on the same package, while also allowing for doing
 * lookups on non-package libraries (pass NULL to `package` and specify a
 * library for `dl_out`).
 *
 * The symbol must point to a global symbol. Different platforms have different
 * rules for which symbols are made visible. If using a corto package, you can
 * use the <package name>_API macro to make symbols globally visible.

/** Register a load action.

 *
 * To load a file of a specified extension, corto will first look in the

 * has found one, it will load the package library as an ordinary package, which
 * means the `cortomain` will be invoked.
 *
 * In the `cortomain` function, the package should call `ut_load_register` to
 * register the load action with corto for the specific extension. If a package
 * in the `driver/ext` scope did not register the extension after running the
 * `cortomain` function, an error will be thrown.

 * loaded as text file, and is then parsed with an XML parser.
